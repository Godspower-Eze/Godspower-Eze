## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

I am **Godspower Eze**, a Software Engineer who enjoys creating content on the web.

I am interested in Blockchain technology, Mathematics, Zero-knowledge Proofs, System design, Design patterns, and Clean code.

I have written a couple of [twitter threads](https://twitter.com/The_python_dev_/status/1374407646762037259) teaching blockchain and I also created [Blockchaintotheworld](blockchaintotheworld.com/) to do the same.

Check out my ongoing series called [30DaysOfSolidity](https://github.com/Godspower-Eze/30DaysOfSolidity) to learn the Solidity programming language.

Visit my personal website: [Godspowereze.com](Godspowereze.com/) for my other works.
