## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br/>

I am **Godspower Eze**, a Software Engineer who enjoys creating content on the web.

I am interested in Blockchain technology, Mathematics, Zero-knowledge Proofs, System design, Design patterns, and Clean code.

I have written over 30 [twitter threads](https://twitter.com/0xgodspower/status/1374407646762037259) teaching blockchain and I also created [Blockchaintotheworld](blockchaintotheworld.com/) to do the same.

Check out my ongoing series called [30DaysOfSolidity](https://github.com/Godspower-Eze/30DaysOfSolidity) to learn the Solidity programming language.

Visit my personal website: [Godspowereze.com](https://godspowereze.com/) for my other works.
